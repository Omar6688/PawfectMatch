## 🏗️ The Structure Plane

### 🔄 Application Structure

The **PawfectMatch** project is built with Django and follows a modular app structure:

- `core`: Handles homepage, navigation, and shared templates (like `base.html`).
- `services`: Displays pet-related services.
- `bookings`: Manages service bookings (via forms and models).
- `support`: Allows users to send support messages.
- `templates/`: Contains app-specific HTML templates, all extending `base.html`.
- `static/`: Will hold custom CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `media/`: Will be used for user-uploaded pet images (in future updates).

All Django apps are logically separated for clarity and reuse.

---

### 🧩 URL Structure

The `urls.py` files are organized to include:

- `accounts/`: For authentication using django-allauth.
- `/`: The core homepage and dynamic pet listing.
- `/services/`: Lists available pet services.
- `/bookings/`: Booking form for logged-in users.
- `/support/`: Support/contact page.
- `admin/`: Django admin panel access for superusers.

---

### 🖥️ Views & Templates

- Each app contains its own views and templates.
- All templates extend `base.html`, which includes the navigation bar and Bootstrap.
- Views are function-based for clarity and simplicity.
- Templates use Django templating language to dynamically render content like pets and services.

---

### 🔐 Authentication & Access Control

- Authentication is handled by **django-allauth**.
- Navigation adjusts based on whether the user is logged in.
- Certain views (like bookings) are protected and require login.

---

### 📊 Data Flow

- Pet data is passed from the `core` views into the homepage and pet detail pages.
- Booking data is submitted via a secure form and saved to the database.
- Admins can access all data via the Django admin panel.

---

## 🦴 The Skeleton Plane

### 🔹 Wireframes

Before development began, wireframes were created to plan the layout and user journey across the most important pages. These low-fidelity Balsamiq-style mockups helped map out responsive layouts, user interactions, and form placements across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The wireframes ensured that the visual hierarchy and user flow aligned with the core goals of the application: promoting pet adoption, simplifying service bookings, and supporting shelter operations.

Each wireframe was used to guide the layout decisions during development and matches the final responsive design.

### 🗃️ Database Design (ERD)

### 🗃️ Database Design (ERD)

The following **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** outlines the core data models and relationships used in the PawfectMatch Django application. Each model reflects a distinct part of the platform's functionality — such as pet adoption, service bookings, user messages, and authentication.

The diagram was created using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io) and is based on the actual Django models implemented in the project.

---

All models are linked logically via **ForeignKey relationships**, and validation is handled at both the model and form levels. Sensitive fields like emails and payment status are properly stored and protected.

---

### 🔐 Security

The following security best practices were implemented to protect user data and maintain integrity of the application:

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented via `django-allauth` to manage user accounts.
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive settings (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials) are hidden using `.env` and `os.environ`.
- **Database Access:** Models such as Bookings are linked to individual users to ensure private access.
- **Custom Error Pages:** Friendly custom templates for 403, 404, and 500 errors to guide the user if issues occur.
- **CSRF Protection:** Enabled by default with Django middleware on all forms.
- **Input Validation:** Forms use Django’s built-in validation and widgets (e.g., date picker) to ensure correct inputs.

## 🎨 The Surface Plane

### 🖥️ Design Overview

PawfectMatch is designed to be warm, welcoming, and user-friendly — reflecting the heart of pet adoption and support. The site uses generous white space, soft contrast, clear buttons, and mobile-first responsiveness to ensure an enjoyable experience on all screen sizes.

Design priorities included:

- A clean **centered layout** with balanced spacing
- Clear, bold **calls to action** (like "View Available Pets")
- Intuitive navigation across **Home**, **Services**, and **Support**
- Consistent use of **Bootstrap 5.3.3** for layout and styling

---

### 🌈 Colour Scheme

The color palette is calm, approachable, and accessible:

| Element         | Color Code | Purpose                                   |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Background      | `#ffffff`  | Clean white for readability               |
| Primary Buttons | `#0d6efd`  | Bootstrap primary blue for CTAs           |
| Text            | `#212529`  | Near-black for optimal contrast           |
| Navigation Bar  | `#f8f9fa`  | Light gray background (Bootstrap default) |
| Links (hover)   | `#0056b3`  | Darker blue for hover feedback            |

All colors were tested for accessibility and clarity on light and dark screens.

---

### 📝 Typography

The site uses the default **Bootstrap typography system**, which ensures clean and responsive type sizing across all screen sizes:

- Font Family: **System font stack** for maximum compatibility
- Heading Sizes: Scalable based on viewport width (`h1` to `h5`)
- Body Text: Readable at `1rem` base size
- Alignment: Centered or left-aligned based on context

Readability was prioritized, especially for mobile users viewing pet details and service forms.

---

### 🖼️ Imagery

Images are central to the project’s emotional tone. Photos of pets are displayed in **cards** with soft shadows, rounded corners, and alt text for accessibility.

- 🐶 **Pet Images**: Shown on the homepage and pet detail page to highlight available animals for adoption.
- 📸 **Service Images**: Will be used to represent grooming, training, and veterinary services.
- 📂 All images are loaded via `image_url` fields and stored externally for performance.
- 🎯 Future optimization using tools like **TinyPNG** will improve performance.

> Note: All images are either owned or sourced from open-license repositories like [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com). Each image will be properly credited in the README.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

PawfectMatch leverages modern, reliable technologies across the front-end and back-end to ensure a responsive and dynamic user experience.

---

## 🛠️ Agile Planning

This project was developed using the Agile methodology and GitHub Projects (Kanban board) to manage tasks and user stories effectively.

A total of **17 user stories** were written, grouped under **4 Epics**:

### 📁 Epics & User Story Themes

| Epic                               | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **User Accounts & Authentication** | Registration, login/logout, profile access, email confirmation           |
| **Adoption Workflow**              | Browse pets, add/delete listings (admin), adopt flow                     |
| **Pet Services & Bookings**        | View services, book, pay via Stripe, see bookings                        |
| **Support & Community Sharing**    | Volunteer info, social sharing, confirmations, and custom error handling |

Each story was created using GitHub Issues with a markdown-based user story template and included clear, testable **acceptance criteria** (3–5 per story).

---

### 📌 Agile Board Structure

The GitHub Project board followed a classic **Kanban** format with three main columns:

- **To Do** – All planned user stories
- **In Progress** – Tasks currently being developed
- **Done** – Completed and verified user stories

Issues were regularly updated and moved between columns throughout development to reflect real progress.
