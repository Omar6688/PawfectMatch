All acceptance criteria were fulfilled for each story. Screenshots will be added later for key flows.



## ‚úÖ Form & Model Validation

All forms in the project use Django‚Äôs `ModelForm` and built-in validation system. Each form was tested with valid and invalid inputs to ensure that validation errors are shown appropriately and that valid submissions are saved correctly.

---

### üßæ Booking Form

- ‚úÖ Required fields: name, email, service, date
- ‚ùå Invalid data (e.g., blank name or invalid email) triggers error messages
- ‚úÖ CSRF token present
- ‚úÖ Stripe payment integration redirects to payment page after form submission

---

### üì© Adoption Interest Form

- ‚úÖ Required fields: name, email, message
- ‚úÖ Optional field: phone
- ‚ùå Invalid inputs are blocked with field-specific error messages
- ‚úÖ Form is only accessible to logged-in users (redirects to login if not)

---

### üì¨ Support Form

- ‚úÖ Required: name, email, message
- ‚úÖ Validated automatically by Django
- ‚úÖ Flash message shown after successful submission

---

### üîê Allauth Registration/Login

- ‚úÖ Signup form validates email format and password match
- ‚úÖ Flash messages shown after login, logout, and signup
- ‚úÖ Redirects to homepage or profile upon login

---

All forms are protected by CSRF tokens, and all submissions are stored securely via Django models. Invalid submissions are never saved.



## üì± Responsive Design Testing

The entire site layout was tested across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens to ensure content remains readable and accessible on all devices.

Responsiveness was implemented using Bootstrap 5‚Äôs grid system and utility classes.

---

### ‚úÖ Devices Tested

| Device Type      | Model/OS                          | Result  |
|------------------|------------------------------------|---------|
| Desktop          | macOS (Chrome, Safari)             | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Laptop           | macOS (Firefox, Chrome)            | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Tablet           | iPad 10.2" (Safari, Chrome)        | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Mobile Phone     | iPhone 13, iPhone SE (Safari)      | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Mobile Emulator  | Chrome DevTools (iOS + Android)    | ‚úÖ Pass |

---

### ‚úÖ Layout Checks

- ‚úÖ Navbar collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile
- ‚úÖ Cards and forms resize correctly without overflow
- ‚úÖ Buttons and text remain clickable/readable on all sizes
- ‚úÖ Pet listings, service list, and forms adjust to viewport width
- ‚úÖ Footer sticks to the bottom when content is short

Screenshots of mobile and tablet views will be added below.



## ‚ôø Accessibility & Performance Testing

### ‚úÖ Accessibility (Lighthouse)

Lighthouse accessibility audits were run on **Home**, **Services**, and **Adoptable Pets** pages using Chrome DevTools. All scored excellent results, confirming the project is accessible to most users.

| Page                | Accessibility Score | Notes                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Home                | ‚úÖ 98%             | Correct structure, keyboard-friendly      |
| Services            | ‚úÖ 98%             | Forms labeled, clean structure            |
| Adoptable Pets      | ‚úÖ 98%             | All pet images include alt text           |

Accessibility was verified using:
- ‚úÖ Chrome Lighthouse
- ‚úÖ axe DevTools browser extension
- ‚úÖ Manual keyboard-only navigation
- ‚úÖ VoiceOver screen reader (macOS)

---

### ‚ö° Performance (Lighthouse)

Lighthouse audits were conducted in both **mobile** and **desktop** modes. Performance was slightly lower on mobile due to large image sizes and loading time (especially **Largest Contentful Paint** issues).

---

#### üè† Home Page

| Mode     | Score | Notes                       |
|----------|-------|-----------------------------|
| Mobile   | 86%   | LCP slightly delayed        |
| Desktop  | 98%   | Excellent speed and layout  |

**Screenshots**

---

#### üê∂ Adoptable Pets Page

| Mode     | Score | Notes                              |
|----------|-------|------------------------------------|
| Mobile   | 68%   | High layout shift and slow LCP     |
| Desktop  | 82%   | Acceptable; faster than mobile     |

#### üíÖ Services Page

| Mode     | Score | Notes                                  |
|----------|-------|----------------------------------------|
| Mobile   | 74%   | LCP: Image-heavy section loads slowly  |
| Desktop  | 88%   | Fast paint time and excellent SEO      |

**Screenshots**

![Lighthouse - Services Desktop](documentation/testing/lighthouse-services-desktop.png)

---

### üìù Performance Summary

- Static files served by **WhiteNoise**
- Minor performance drops on mobile due to:
  - ‚ùó Large pet images not compressed or lazy-loaded
  - ‚ùó Largest Contentful Paint delays (notably on image-heavy pages)
- No blocking scripts or rendering issues found

---

### ‚úÖ Improvement Opportunities (Post-submission)

- üîß Implement [image compression](https://tinypng.com/)
- üîß Enable `loading="lazy"` on `<img>` elements
- üîß Consider reducing initial image payload on mobile
- üîß Break long listings into paginated views

---

### üìã Final Verdict

Accessibility, SEO, and best practices all score 90‚Äì100%. Performance is strong on desktop and good enough on mobile for Code Institute submission (60+ is considered acceptable). Issues identified do not break the experience and are logged in [Known Issues](#known-issues).


## ‚úÖ Validation Testing

Validation tools were used to check for errors, warnings, and best practice compliance across the project.

---

### ‚úÖ HTML Validation (W3C)

The homepage (`base.html`) was tested using the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

‚úÖ **Result**: No errors found after correcting misplaced `<body>` and `<script>` tags.

![HTML Validation Result for Homepage](documentation/testing/html-validator.png)

---

### CSS Validation

The deployed CSS file was tested using the W3C CSS Validation Service:  
[https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

![CSS Validation Screenshot](documentation/testing/css-validation.png)

- ‚úÖ No errors or warnings were found in the CSS file.
- The code passes validation and meets modern web standards for styling.


### Python Code Validation - flake8 ‚úÖ

The project‚Äôs Python code was validated using the `flake8` linter to check for syntax and style issues.

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ No critical errors were found.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è A few minor warnings were reported, including:
  - `E501`: Line too long (exceeding 79 characters).
  - `F401`: Unused imports (mostly in test or placeholder code).
  - `E302`, `E305`: Expected 2 blank lines before/after function or class definitions.

These are all considered minor stylistic issues and **do not impact functionality or runtime behavior**.

**Conclusion:**
The Python code is clean and functional. Minor flake8 warnings were reviewed and documented, and may be addressed in future refactoring for enhanced code readability.


---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Deployment Checks

‚úÖ Heroku deployment was tested with:

- `DEBUG = False` in production
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS` set correctly
- Environment variables handled securely via `env.py` and `os.getenv()`
- `collectstatic` completed with no errors
- AWS S3 correctly serves media files
- Stripe and email confirmation work on production

Screenshots of validator results will be added below.



## üêû Bug Fixes & Known Issues

---

### ‚úÖ Fixed Bugs During Development

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| AWS S3 images not displaying | Reconfigured `USE_AWS`, ensured `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` and credentials were set properly |
| Stripe session not redirecting | Adjusted `success_url` and `cancel_url` to use `request.build_absolute_uri()` |
| Booking edit errors | Added missing `redirect` import in `bookings/views.py` |
| Media files broken in Heroku | Ran `collectstatic` and confirmed correct S3 bucket setup |
| Profile page crash for normal users | Conditional logic added to only show staff edit/delete buttons |
| Delete button not confirming | Added JavaScript confirmation to `script.js` |
| Pet image field migration error | Provided default during migration or manually set values |

---

### üöß Known Issues (Documented for Transparency)

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Email confirmation takes a few seconds | Expected delay with Gmail SMTP |
| No pagination for pet listings | All pets shown in a single scrollable view |
| No image compression | Large pet images may slightly slow load time (planned TinyPNG integration) |
| Email confirmation warning | Django 5.2 emits: `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS conflicts with ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS` (non-critical) |
| Django development warning | "Do not use this server in production" shown during local testing (expected) |

These issues are not critical and do not affect functionality.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix: 500 Error on Adoption Interest Form

**Issue:** A `500 Server Error` occurred on the live Heroku site after submitting the adoption interest form.  
**Cause:** `interest_success.html` was missing from the committed templates, or wasn't deployed correctly.  
**Fix:** Confirmed the template was inside the app's templates folder, committed it, and redeployed the app via Heroku dashboard.  
**Verification:** Tested both locally and on live Heroku site ‚Äî success page now loads correctly.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix: `no such table: django_session` Error on Live

**Issue:** When `DEBUG=True` was enabled for troubleshooting, Heroku raised `OperationalError: no such table: django_session`.  
**Fix:** Ran `python manage.py migrate` inside Heroku dyno to ensure session table was created in the live PostgreSQL DB.  
**Result:** The app now loads properly even with `DEBUG=False` and all forms function correctly.
