## Manual Testing

All key pages and user interactions were manually tested across multiple devices and browsers using both the local development server and the live Heroku deployment.

Each user state (logged in / anonymous / staff) was tested with expected and unexpected input.

| Page                         | Tests Performed                                                                 |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homepage                     | Loads properly, header and CTA visible                                          |
| Allauth Pages                | Sign up, login, logout flows working and redirecting properly                   |
| Service Booking              | Form validation, Stripe integration, booking confirmation tested                |
| Adoption Flows               | List and detail views tested, form submission redirects to success page         |

| User Profile                 | Displays logged-in user bookings                                                |
| Admin Dashboard              | Staff can add/edit/delete pets and services                                     |
| Custom Error Pages           | 403, 404, 500 tested using edge cases and broken routes                         |

## Form & Model Validation

Django‚Äôs `ModelForm` validation was tested thoroughly.

- **Booking Form**: All required fields and date picker validated.
- **Adoption Interest**: Validates name/email/message, only available to logged-in users.
- **Volunteer/Support Form**: Clean error handling, CSRF tokens present.
- **Allauth Forms**: Password confirmation and email format validated.

All forms reject invalid submissions and show field-specific errors.

## Responsive Design Testing

Tested on:

| Device           | Browser(s)         | Result     |
|------------------|--------------------|------------|
| MacBook Air      | Chrome, Safari     | ‚úÖ Pass     |
| iPhone 13        | Safari, Chrome     | ‚úÖ Pass     |
| iPad             | Safari             | ‚úÖ Pass     |
| Windows Laptop   | Edge, Chrome       | ‚úÖ Pass     |
| Chrome Emulator  | iOS + Android      | ‚úÖ Pass     |

Bootstrap 5 ensures layout is fully responsive. Navbar collapses properly and all forms/buttons scale well.
